In Java Swing, layout managers are responsible for determining the size and position of components within a container such as a JPanel. Different layout managers have different rules for how components are arranged.

Here are some commonly used layout managers and their basic behavior:

1. **FlowLayout**: Components are arranged in a row, and when the row is full, the next component moves to the next row.
   
   ```java
   JPanel panel = new JPanel(new FlowLayout());
   panel.add(component1);
   panel.add(component2);
   // Components will be added in a row-wise manner
   ```

2. **BorderLayout**: Divides the container into five regions: NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, and CENTER. Components added with this layout manager will occupy these regions.
   
   ```java
   JPanel panel = new JPanel(new BorderLayout());
   panel.add(component1, BorderLayout.NORTH);
   panel.add(component2, BorderLayout.CENTER);
   // Components will be added to specific regions of the container
   ```

3. **GridLayout**: Components are arranged in a grid of rows and columns.
   
   ```java
   JPanel panel = new JPanel(new GridLayout(rows, columns));
   panel.add(component1);
   panel.add(component2);
   // Components will be added in a grid pattern
   ```

4. **BoxLayout**: Arranges components in a single row or column.
   
   ```java
   JPanel panel = new JPanel();
   panel.setLayout(new BoxLayout(panel, BoxLayout.Y_AXIS)); // Y_AXIS for vertical, X_AXIS for horizontal
   panel.add(component1);
   panel.add(component2);
   // Components will be added in a single row or column based on BoxLayout axis
   ```

5. **GridBagLayout**: Provides a flexible and powerful layout, allowing components to span multiple rows and columns.
   
   ```java
   JPanel panel = new JPanel(new GridBagLayout());
   GridBagConstraints gbc = new GridBagConstraints();
   gbc.gridx = 0;
   gbc.gridy = 0;
   panel.add(component1, gbc);
   gbc.gridx = 1;
   gbc.gridy = 0;
   panel.add(component2, gbc);
   // Components will be added based on GridBagConstraints
   ```

Each layout manager has its own set of properties and constraints that you can set to control how components are positioned and sized within a container. Understanding these layout managers helps in creating well-structured and responsive user interfaces in Java Swing.
